    Followup email from Philip after the 20200929 IRIS-TWG telecon

        Hi Dave,

        Do we need to follow up further on the memory per core question from todays TWG. E.g. is it currently causing you any problems at this point?

        Kind regards,

        Philip Jackson

    reply to Philip, cc to Nigel.

        Hi Philip,

        I think most of this will be down to a discussion between ourselves and the system administrators of the Openstack system at Cambridge.
        I'm looking to make the best use of the hardware that we have by adjusting the limits applied in Openstack to closer reflect the physical
        machines we are running on. My initial question was just to understand what the cpu:mem ratio is on the hardware that is currently being deployed.

        Openstack applies two set of limits on the number of cores and amount of memory that we can use. The first set of limits are the top level
        resource limits applied to each of our Openstack projects. We have three projects on the Openstack system at Cambridge, gaia-dev, gaia-test
        and gaia-prod, each of which is allowed 20 virtual machines, 200 cores, and 500GB of memory. Given the current limits, even if one of our
        projects used all 200 cores available to it then it could still only access a maximum of 500GB of memory, which limits us to a ratio of
        2.5GB of memory per cpu core.

        The second set of limits are set by the set of virtual machine sizes that we can create. The current configuration on the Cumulus platform
        includes 5 flavors of virtual machine, tiny, small, medium, large and xlarge. The tiny, small, medium and large flavors all have a cpu:mem
        ratio around 3, and the xlarge flavor has a cpu:mem ratio of 6. We would like to experiment with creating some new virtual machine flavors
        with cpu:mem ratios that are closer to the physical hardware and make better use of the available resources.

        We don't need to make the virtual machines map exactly on to the physical hardware. Not least because we will need to keep some resources
        to free to handle the overhead of running the Openstack system. However, the if the actual ratio really is somewhere between 8GB to 12GB
        memory per core, then the current limit of 2.5GB per core leaves a lot of unused resources.

        Cheers,
        -- Dave
