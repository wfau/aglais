    Accessing the dashboard
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/#accessing-the-dashboard-ui

        To protect your cluster data, Dashboard deploys with a minimal RBAC configuration by default.
        Currently, Dashboard only supports logging in with a Bearer Token. To create a token for this
        demo, you can follow our guide on creating a sample user.
