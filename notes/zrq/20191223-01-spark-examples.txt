    How feasible is it to get GDAF set up with (preferably) DR2 installed in time to do this?
    We’d need it up and running before the end of the year (i.e. before the Xmas break) I think to leave time
    (a few working weeks) in which to import and shake down some code from some friendly person
    ... even then it would be tight.

    For candidate friendly persons I see three options:
        i) Roger Mor and his SFH application (we know it already runs on GDAF and can compare the
           results against existing ones as well as benchmark performance);
       ii) Marina Kounkel’s HDBSCAN for unsupervised ML clustering (she said she’s willing to share
           code; possible con is that this is not spark-specific, more traditional HPC I suppose);
      iii) Bob’s student (re that draft paper I sent a while ago) which again is unsupervised ML,
           this time random forest treatment of light/curves and periodogram parameter analysis.

       For iii) we could “only” (!) run on half a million light curves totalling 2GB from DR2;
       again it’s currently not implemented in Spark and indeed both ii) and iii) are probably
       better implemented in somehow plain parallelised python rather than Spark. It might be
       safer to not try to do any of these given the Xmas break, and our complete lack of knowledge
       of any of these. I’m not confident about the scientific usefulness of iii) anyway
       (the available light curves are already a cleanly classified selection of a few known type
       of variables).

        Got the paper, with the math, but not the code ..
