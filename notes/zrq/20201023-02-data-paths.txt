    Science data paths :

        /aglais/data/gaia/dr2

        /aglais/data/panstarrs/dr1

        /aglais/data/2mass/dr1

        /aglais/data/wise/allsky

    User data paths :

        /aglais/user/nch

        /aglais/user/stv

        /aglais/user/zrq

    How do we configure the file shares to match this ?
    For the existing Gaia-DR2 data, easiest is probably to create a new share and copy the data across.
