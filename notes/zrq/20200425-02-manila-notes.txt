    # Client README, example gives v2 auth URL.
    # Should we be using v2 not v3 ?

        You'll need to provide your OpenStack username and password. You can do this with the --os-username, --os-password and --os-tenant-name params, but it's easier to just set them as environment variables:

        export OS_USERNAME=foouser
        export OS_PASSWORD=barpass
        export OS_TENANT_NAME=fooproject

        You will also need to define the authentication url either with param --os-auth-url or as an environment variable:

        export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:5000/v2.0/
