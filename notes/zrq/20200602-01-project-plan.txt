        Do we allow anonymous access to Zeppelin ?
            Do we want to allow anonymous to run a set of simple examples ?
            Can we make Zeppelin notebook examples read-only but still runnable ?

        Do we allow anonymous access to the documentation ?

            Result of login is a browser session cookie linked to the Aglais account.

            Aglais account level sets the packages and resources that are available.

            Do we need to create a Unix login name and ID for each user ?
                Do we create Unix logins for nch, stv and dmr ?
                If so, then it would be the Aglais account manager that creates and maintains the Unix login names and IDs.

            Data storage manager connects NFS or CephFS share of the user's storage space to the Kubernetes Pods running the user's Zeppelin and Spark session.
