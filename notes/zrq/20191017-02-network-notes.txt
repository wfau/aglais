    Looking through OpenStack GUI, found list of Cluster templates
    https://cumulus.openstack.hpc.cam.ac.uk/project/cluster_templates

    The Cambridge system has templates for swarm, kubernetes-1.14.6 and kubernetes-1.15.3 and

    The Kubernetes clusters use Flannel to create the network.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/
    https://github.com/coreos/flannel
    "Flannel is a simple and easy way to configure a layer 3 network fabric designed for Kubernetes."

    The Kubernetes clusters use Traefik for the ingest controller
    https://traefik.io/
        "The Cloud Native Edge Router"
        "An open-source reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP and TCP-based applications that is easy,
        dynamic, automatic, fast, full-featured, production proven, provides metrics, and integrates with
        every major cluster technology."

    Uses VXLAN
