    Bringing all the things together.

    Can we add user accounts to Zeppelin
    Can we combine user accounts and OAuth proxy
    Can we use a database (SQL or LDAP) for the user accounts.

    Can we add a local container registry

    Can we re-use an existing Manila share

    Need to make the share mount more generic in the interpreter-spec
        Follow the pattern used in Kubernetes config
            spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim...



    What Zeppelin actions can we hook
        Execute a cell
        Submit a Spark job
        ...

    How much do users share
    Can we create user space on demand
    Can we control access to user space
        Protected shares in Manila

    Performance benchmarks
        notes/svt/20200429-apache-arrow.txt
        notes/svt/20200430-benchmarks.txt

    Nigel's examples.
        Need numpy, pandas etc.
        Need to fix on Python3.


    Future enhancments
        Move from Cinder provisioner to Cinder CSI plugin.
        Move from Malila provisioner to Manila CSI plugin.

        Move things into separate namespaces

    Two levels of HTTP proxy
        Zeppelin deploy already has an Nginx proxy
        Is this an issue ?
