    Apache Spark on Kubernetes
    https://apache-spark-on-k8s.github.io/userdocs/index.html
    https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark

        This repository apache-spark-on-k8s/spark, contains a fork of Apache Spark
        that enables running Spark jobs natively on a Kubernetes cluster.

        ** NOTE this repository is being ARCHIVED as all new development for the
        kubernetes scheduler back-end is now on https://github.com/apache/spark/ **

        Spark-RSS The Resource Staging Server (RSS) watches Spark driver pods to detect
        completed Spark applications so it knows when to safely delete resource bundles of the applications.

    SPIP: Support native submission of spark jobs to a kubernetes cluster
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18278

        This fork is no longer being maintained, because Kubernetes support is
        now being built and available on mainline.

        Spark 2.3 introduced basic support for Kubernetes.
        Spark 2.4 will have Python support.
        Dynamic allocation is being reworked, see my comment above.

    Java security
    https://shiro.apache.org/

        Apache Shiroâ„¢ is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs
        authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management.

        Used by Zeppelin.
