    This page<https://rse-cambridge.github.io/iris-openstack/cambridge> has some docs on initially auth'ing to the system;
    We're currently using a dev instance of EGI AAI while a full Indigo IAM install is prepared for IRIS, so need a first
    successful login to create federee accounts in the system.

    So for an initial login to get you both into the system you could first try your institutional ROE logins with the
    federated login access method, or Grid certificates if you have them.

    ...

    IRIS OpenStack @ Cambridge University

    The Cambirdge University IRIS OpenStack deployment is part of the Cumulus supercomputer.

    For more details please contact John Taylor, StackHPC.

    ----
    Authentication

    Please vist the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard to login, selecting “Federated Login”:
    https://cumulus.openstack.hpc.cam.ac.uk/

    This will redirect you, via a local Keycloak instances, to EGI AAI (dev instance).
    Because we currently only use the dev instance, only grid certificates, google accounts,
    and similar are expected to work. Please choose a method that works best for you.

    Once IRIS’s Indigo IAM setup has access to edugain, the hope is to switch all accounts
    to that system. Once complete, you should be able to use your home institution credentials
    in a very similar way to the social account.

    We are using social credentails to help get early feedback on using this federated approach.

    ----
    Authorization

    Once you are able to authenticate with OpenStack, we now need to get you access to some
    resources within OpenStack.

    While it is hoped Keycloak and/or Indio IAM will eventualy automate the group membership
    workflow, this is currently a fairly manual process that can be kickstarted by opening a
    bug against this github repository: https://github.com/RSE-Cambridge/cumulus-config/issues

    Please tell us:

        what project you are working on (LSST, Euclid, etc)
        your social email address used to authenticate
        your home instituion email address

    This is a manual process. Asking in the #openstack channel in slack may speed things up.

    Hi Dave,

    I've added you to the federation mapping now, so if you try to log in using your GMail account you should get a successful login but not be associated with a project (and so no have any access to the Gaia project resources).

    That login creates your user in the Cambridge Iris OpenStack backend though, for me to go ahead and add it to the Gaia project, so we can do that once you've successfully logged in.

    Thanks,
    Paul
