    # Rename our branch because the topic changed, again.
    # We started out planning to work on Kubernetes, but we got
    # diverted trying to get OpenStack Magnum to work.
    #

    #
    # Slight wrinkle .. we already have an open pull request for this branch.
    # GitHub closed the pull request automatically when the branch was renamed.
