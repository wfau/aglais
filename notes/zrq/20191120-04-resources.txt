    Floating IP addresses, 8 on all three projects
        The xxx clusters allocate a floating address to all the minions.
        If that is out of scope, what are the templates there for ?

    Security groups and security rules.
        Each service type uses different rules.
        Magnum clusters automatically create several groups and rules.
        Security groups > 20 on all three projects
        Security rule > 200 on all three projects

    If the cumulus-internal network is deprecated, can we remove it ?
