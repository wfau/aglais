    ReadOnlyMany doesn't work.
    ReadWriteMany works in the end
    ReadWriteOnce works in the end

    Short term : we can use ReadWriteMany to test the rest of the system ..
    Long term  : Need to put all these into a loop and automate the testing.

    We also have three sets of credentials to experiment with.
