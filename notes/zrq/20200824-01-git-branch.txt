    Starting with a normal branch and then merging in commits from previous branches.
    I need to do this because I need the notes from previous branches to work on this one.

    This would probably be a disaster on a project with multiple people making
    changes to the same code base.
    At the moment it is mostly me adding new notes and code to the project,
    so hopefully cross branch merges won't cause too many conflicts.

    Do not do this at home folks.

    Keeping detailed notes like this so if everything goes pear shaped and we need to
    recover it, then the notes will show how we got into the mess in the first place.
