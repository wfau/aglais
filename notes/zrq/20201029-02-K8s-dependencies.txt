    Interesting connection - the certificate handler for NGinx is developed and maintained by Walmart.

    Saw this in the Helm debug output and wondered where it comes from.

    Found the image on Docker hub.

        Kubernetes webhook certificate generator and patcher
        https://hub.docker.com/r/jettech/kube-webhook-certgen

            Generates a CA and leaf certificate with a long (100y) expiration,
            then patches Kubernetes Admission Webhooks by setting the caBundle
            field with the generated CA. Can optionally patch the hooks
            failurePolicy setting - useful in cases where a single Helm chart
            needs to provision resources and hooks at the same time as patching.

    No direct reference to GitHub, but a little Google-foo found this.
