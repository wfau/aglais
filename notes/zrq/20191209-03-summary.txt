    Summary of the timing issues with Cumulus OpenStack at Cambridge.

    First reference to the timing issues, 28th November 2019.

    Timing issues reported using client on desktop at Exeter.
    Connected via home ADSL line.

        Slack - 11:25 AM
            ---- ----
            "I'm experimenting with using Magnum to create K8 clusters, and some of the API calls are taking a long time (~90 sec) to resolve."
            "I'm working from home, so the connection is via my ADSL line to my ISP to Cambridge to the OpenStack system .... which means the issue could be anywhere in that chain"
            "however, ping tests and curl to other sites don't show any problems"

        Timing issues replicated using 'jump host' inside the Cumulus cloud.

            # Created a 'jump host' to acces the cluster from inside the private network.
