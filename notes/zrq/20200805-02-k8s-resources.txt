    Can we use Kubernetes resources to schedule Spark jobs ?
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

    Extended resources look promising ..
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources


        Cluster scheduling level resources
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#cluster-level-extended-resources

        Consuming extended resources
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#consuming-extended-resources

            A Pod is scheduled only if all of the resource requests are satisfied, including CPU,
            memory and any extended resources.
            The Pod remains in the PENDING state as long as the resource request cannot be satisfied.
