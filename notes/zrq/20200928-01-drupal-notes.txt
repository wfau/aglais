    Deployment worked.

    To add a new module or theme, add the component to the list in our Dockermod file.
    Build a new Docker image, and push to the Docker Hub.
    Edit the image version in the Drupal deployment.
    Re-apply fixes to the ConfigMap (reverts to the original).

    Best Theme so far is Bootstrap4
    Tried Bootstrap3 and has issues.
    Tried Business Responsive - didn't feel right.
