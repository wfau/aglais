    JupyterLab/Hub 11th Feb 2020, 15:00-16:30

    John G.
    Cloud team
    Onboarding help etc.


    Paul Hopkins

        Students go straight for the JupyterLabs interface
        No one (few) use the ssh terminal.

    John Garbut

        JupyterNB  (classic)
        JupyterLab (replaces classic)
        JupyterHub (multi-user, creates notebooks)

        iris-magnum
        https://github.com/RSE-Cambridge/iris-magnum

        Terraform
            resizes cluster

        Helm3
            (removes tiller component)
            (removes --name)

        Mangnum requires Helm2
            avoid conflistc

        Example of config with IRIS IAM

        Plans for 2020

            Node types
                GPU

        Manilla
            CephFS via NFS gateway
            Manilla creates (hides) the CephFS keys

        Auth via AAAI
            remote user id needs a mapping

            JupyterHub creates accounts
            but doesn't map to outside

        Slurm OpenOnDemand
            local posix user mapped to remote user
            automated via groups attributes

        Dev  cluster is using IAM
            Iris Authentication Mechanism <- preferred

        Prod cluster is using EGI checkin <- legacy

        Reads logs to check start/stop events - builds totals of useage accounting

        Reliability issues with OpenStack system at RAL.

        Ranger - not ideal

            In production, get used to it.
            Complicated to use.
            Difficult to recover from errors.

        Modifying the Jupyter Docker image to add packages for users.

        Login to LSST:UK system
            Spawner options:
                Choice of Jupyter image
                K8s cpu limits
                Group - ??

    John Garbut

        Portability between systems - change the name of the Magnum template in Terraform
        Template contains details of the network config.
        Next year, hoping to have GPU option.

        Helm charts can be used like Lego bricks.

    George
        Proposing meeting (hackathon) for everyone to meet and try out.

    Gareth
        Where the lines are between Lego bricks

    Accounting via APEL ??

    George
        If small, then can be contributions from exising projects.
        Or this could be framed as a digital asset to provide funding.

    John GB
        Rucio in notebooks ?
        Import data into Rucio ObjectStore.
        Replicate to other nodes.

    Existing deployments
        RAL Rucio
        Cambridge Rucio

    Digital asset ?
    3 day workshop in Bristol ?
        Standard templates for
            IRIS authentication (IAM)
            IRIS accounting
            IRIS Rucio storage
