    Using Spark and Zeppelin to process big data on Kubernetes 1.2 (2016)

    Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/

    The current deploy is not using an auto scaler to control the number of Spark workers.
    The number of workers is fixed as a property on the Spark session.

    Autoscale of Openstack resources is working.

        Increased the size of the worker nodes in the interpreter properties.
        Doubled the size if the worker nodes, 1g 1core to 2g 2core.
        Kubernetes dashboard flagged errors in provisioning the Pods - not enough resources.
        Kubernetes found the resources and allocated the Pods.
        Openstack Horizon showed 2 new virtual machines allocated.
