    # https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-eu-2017/public/schedule/detail/57598

        In tests, running DFSIO on Hadoop with Stocator achieved a 37% speed up for write
        flows and a 96% speed up for the read flows compared to Hadoop with its native object
        store connectors, while running Terasort on Spark with Stocator achieved a 500% speedup
        compared to the native connectors. Wordcount on Spark, where the output is much smaller
        than the input, achieved a 100% speedup.
