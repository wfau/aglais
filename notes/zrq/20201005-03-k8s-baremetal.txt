    Options for installing K8s on baremetal servers.

    We have the two Gaia testbed machines at ROE.
    Only one of which is reachable at the moment.
    Running Debian 10.
    If we break them, we need to wait for Mark to do a site vist to reboot them.

    Potentially a fairly large cluster at ROE using all of the Esperia resources.
    Need to be well practiced at deploying things before we try these.

    Local hardware for initial experiments
        3 desktop machines
        4 core, 16G RAM each
