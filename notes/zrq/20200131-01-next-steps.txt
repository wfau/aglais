    # We have Hadoop binaries on managers and workers
    # We have Spark binaries on managers
    # We have no-password SSH from managers to workers

    # We need to know which ports to open on managers and workers

    # Do we need to add data volumes to each worker ?
    # Only if we want to store large data in HDFS.
