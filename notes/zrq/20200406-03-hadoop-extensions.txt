    ha.zookeeper.parent-znode       The ZooKeeper znode under which the ZK failover controller stores its information.
                                    Note that the nameservice ID is automatically appended to this znode, so it is not normally necessary to configure this, even in a federated environment.

    HDFS Architecture
    https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.2.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html



        Another option to increase resilience against failures is to enable High Availability using multiple NameNodes
        either with a shared storage on NFS or using a distributed edit log (called Journal).
