    Rebuild from clean ....

    Issues to solve:
        1. Kubernetes couldn't find the image for our Spark container.
            - problem occurred when we changed the image name in the data map
            - short term, start with the right image name
            - longer term, add a local docker registry inside K8s
        2. Building the container images was a complete pain.
            - uploading 3G byte images via ADSL is not an option
            - building images ran out of space on ischnura VMs
            - notes are half way between docker and podman
            - create a java build container that works in podman
            - update the ischnura VM images
            - document how to set the size on an ischnura VM
            - document how to run the builder inside K8s
        3. Running a Spark example failed with insufficent resources.
            - we were using tiny images, which only have 512M of RAM
            - short term, nuke it and create with larger VMs
            - use Magnum to administer the cluster
            - learn K8s/Magnum autoscaling from John's example
        4. HTTP connection to Zeppelin
            - Add K8s https ingress in front of Zeppelin
            - Add https to Zeppelin
        5. Need to create a set of test notebooks
            - Built into our Zeppelin image
            - Imported from external source
                - http
                - git
            - Invoked using Zeppelin REST interface
