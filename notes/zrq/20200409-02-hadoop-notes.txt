    # Ansible deploy of HDFS
    # https://github.com/teralytics/ansible-hdfs
    
        This role supports two different modes of installation:

            Single Namenode with Secondary Namenode
            Two Namenodes in HA mode

        The number of namenodes specifies the mode. If two namenodes are specified HDFS will be installed in an HA fashion.    

        ....

        The tests are run using molecule and a docker container.

        Molecule project is designed to aid in the development and testing of Ansible roles.

        .. lots to learn here ...

    # Ansible HDFS module.

        Ansible modules for interacting with HDFS. Provides functionality similar to the core Ansible file module for the HDFS filesystem.
        
        Target hosts must have the hdfs3 python module and libhdfs3.so shared library installed. See here for installation instructions.
        .. problem here, I think hdfs3 is no longer supported
        .. last commits were 3 years ago

        This project is not undergoing development  
                
        Pyarrowâ€™s JNI hdfs interface is mature and stable.
        It also has fewer problems with configuration and various security settings, and does not require the complex build process of libhdfs3.
        Therefore, all users who have trouble with hdfs3 are recommended to try pyarrow.
