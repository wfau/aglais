    The Pros and Cons of Running Apache Spark on Kubernetes
    https://www.datamechanics.co/blog-post/pros-and-cons-of-running-apache-spark-on-kubernetes

        Spark itself doesn't manage these machines.
        It needs a cluster manager (also sometimes called scheduler).
        The main cluster-managers are:

            * Standalone: Simple cluster-manager, limited in features, incorporated with Spark.

            * Apache Mesos: An open source cluster-manager once popular for big data workloads (not just Spark)
                but in decline over the last few years.

            * Hadoop YARN: The JVM-based cluster-manager of hadoop released in 2012 and most commonly used to date,
                both for on-premise (e.g. Cloudera, MapR) and cloud (e.g. EMR, Dataproc, HDInsight) deployments.

            * Kubernetes: Spark runs natively on Kubernetes since version Spark 2.3 (2018).
                This deployment mode is gaining traction quickly as well as enterprise backing
                (Google, Palantir, Red Hat, Bloomberg, Lyft). As of June 2020 its support is still
                marked as experimental though.
