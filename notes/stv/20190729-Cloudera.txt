## Pull official Cloudera image
docker pull cloudera/quickstart:latest




## Start Cloudera container
docker run --hostname=quickstart.cloudera --privileged=true -t -i -v /home/stelios/projects/gaia/cloudera:/src --publish-all=true -p 8888:8888 -p 81:80 -p 7180:7180  cloudera/quickstart /usr/bin/docker-quickstart



## Ensure that hue is running
[root@quickstart /]# service hue start
Starting hue: already running


## By default, cloudera manager is not started in container, so, lets enable it first.
[root@quickstart /]# /home/cloudera/cloudera-manager --express


## Open in browser

# Hue: http://0.0.0.0:8888 username: cloudera / password: cloudera
# Cloudera Live: http://0.0.0.0:81/#/

# Cloudera Manager http://0.0.0.0:32771/cmf/home
# username: cloudera
# password: cloudera



## Number of errors show up in Cloudera Manager

date      # will show difference between real date and server one
sudo chkconfig --add ntpd
sudo service ntpd restart 
date      # to make sure that ntpd is working and date is sync
