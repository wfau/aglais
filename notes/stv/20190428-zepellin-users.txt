## ----------------------------------------------- Managing Zepellin User accounts -----------------------------------------------




## Log into Zeppelin Nodes
## ------------------------------------------------------------

ssh fedora@stv-dev-zeppelin



## Edit a user account
## ------------------------------------------------------------


pushd ${HOME}/zeppelin/conf


    ## User and Admin account information can be found in file: shiro.ini 
    ## /home/fedora/zeppelin/conf/shiro.ini

    nano shiro.ini

	..

	[users]
	# List of users with their password allowed to access Zeppelin.
	# To use a different strategy (LDAP / Database / ...) check the shiro doc at http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-INISections
	# To enable admin user, uncomment the following line and set an appropriate password.

	admin = pass, admin
	username = pass, role1

       ..



    ## To add a new user, add a line under the "[users]" section 

    newuser = newpass, role1, role2

    ## newuser -> username 
    ## newpass -> password
    ## role (List) -> A list of roles. There is a roles section in the configuration which creates a number of different roles
    ##                  The roles on the current setup are all set to *, meaning full permissions
  

    ## If we want to edit an account, we can just edit the line where that user is defined 

popd



## Restart Zeppelin
## ------------------------------------------------------------

/home/fedora/zeppelin/bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart

	> Zeppelin stop                                              [  OK  ]
	> Zeppelin start                                             [  OK  ]
