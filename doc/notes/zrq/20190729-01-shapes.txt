    # Why use Cassandra ?

    # Is it better than just Parquet files ?

    # Use Ansible to deploy on Esperia, Eleanor and Cambridge systems.


    # Flexibility to deply different data sources.

    # How much do we use containers for ?

        Containers makes our code portable for others to use.
        Containers isolates our code from the hardware.

        Virtual networks are good thing (in general) but IP addresses and names become skewed.
        Add to that the broken way OpenStack handles floating addresses :-(

        Containers run as root :-(

    # Distributed SQL engine :-o

    # Rootless containers.
    # This is a good thing :-)

    # Are these better than using a Docker file ?
