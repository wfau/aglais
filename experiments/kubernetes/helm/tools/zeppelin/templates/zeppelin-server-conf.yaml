  # 'serviceDomain' is a Domain name to use for accessing Zeppelin UI.
  # Should point IP address of 'zeppelin-server' service.
  #
  # Wildcard subdomain need to be point the same IP address to access service inside of Pod (such as SparkUI).
  # i.e. if service domain is 'local.zeppelin-project.org', DNS configuration should make 'local.zeppelin-project.org' and '*.local.zeppelin-project.org' point the same address.
  #
  # Default value is 'local.zeppelin-project.org' while it points 127.0.0.1 and `kubectl port-forward zeppelin-server` will give localhost to connects.
  # If you have your ingress controller configured to connect to `zeppelin-server` service and have a domain name for it (with wildcard subdomain point the same address), you can replace serviceDomain field with your own domain.
